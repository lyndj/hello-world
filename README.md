# hello-world

Hi Everyone! 

It's me, the former technophobe. 
After being thrown into the pit of ambiguity in my former experimental workplace, 
I had to quickly learn the ropes of digital marketing where I had to constantly deal with web management, social media marketing & email marketing. 
As with every one in the digital marketing field, we all pretend to know what we do not know.
Fueled by my stubborn curiosity, I took on the responsibility of understanding the foundamentals and I believe it starts from undertanding how the digital sphere work. 
I dug through the history of the internet, learnt HTML & CSS, dipped my toes in SEO and committed 19 hours of digital marketing online course. 
But I needed to create something to make my understanding tangible. 

With that, I am on the mission to build my own website by teaching myself to code. 

As a technophobe turned noob, I hope to stumble across kind-hearted individuals who would be kind enough to direct me
